# Allied_12_bit_unpack
Unpacking of 12bit mono packed images made with Vimba Viewer (Allied Technologies cameras).

Original plugin by Wayne Rasband (wayne@codon.nih.gov): https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/expander.html.

Allied Techologies is using different byte order so the old plugin doesn't creates correct image.
